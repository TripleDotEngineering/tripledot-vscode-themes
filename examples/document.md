# Methodology

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book.

## Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

### A third level title

A full-text screening of 64 records was conducted. Studies that did not
sufficiently address or support the specific topic objectives of this review
were then eliminated. A preliminary full-text screening reduced the record
set to 52 articles. After deeper read of the remaining 52 papers, 24 were either
directly related or provided support for answering the research questions
of this literature review.
